解题思路：
1.首先要明白题意，题目中说哈夫曼算法可以得到最优编码，但是最优编码不一定通过哈夫曼算法得到，
也就是说最优编码可能不唯一，哈夫曼算法得到的只是其中一种。

2.哈夫曼编码的特点：

1.最优编码――总长度（WPL）最小
2.无歧义解码――前缀码：数据仅存于叶子节点
3.没有度为1的结点――满足前两条一定有第三条：可以用反证法，如果有一个结点的度为1，
  那么这个结点就不是编码的结点，而这个度为1的结点肯定可以去掉，就不满足1了。

3.要判断提交的哈夫曼编码是否正确，就要判断通过提交的哈夫曼编码建的树是否符合哈夫曼编码的特点1和2。

4.判断特点1或2，都需要建树来检查是否符合，我们通过哈夫曼算法的到最小WPL和建完树的WPL比较。建树这一步，
我考虑可不可以通过判断两棵树是否同构来判断是否是最优编码，但是即使不同构也可能是最优编码，所以不能这么判断。

Huffman Codes

In 1953, David A. Huffman published his paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes",
and hence printed his name in the history of computer science. As a professor who gives the final exam 
problem on Huffman codes, I am encountering a big problem: the Huffman codes are NOT unique. For example, 
given a string "aaaxuaxz", we can observe that the frequencies of the characters 'a', 'x', 'u' and 'z' 
are 4, 2, 1 and 1, respectively. We may either encode the symbols as {'a'=0, 'x'=10, 'u'=110, 'z'=111}, 
or in another way as {'a'=1, 'x'=01, 'u'=001, 'z'=000}, both compress the string into 14 bits. Another 
set of code can be given as {'a'=0, 'x'=11, 'u'=100, 'z'=101}, but {'a'=0, 'x'=01, 'u'=011, 'z'=001} is
NOT correct since "aaaxuaxz" and "aazuaxax" can both be decoded from the code 00001011001001. The students 
are submitting all kinds of codes, and I need a computer program to help me determine which ones are correct
and which ones are not.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives an integer N (2≤N≤63), 
then followed by a line that contains all the N distinct characters and their frequencies in the following
format:
c[1] f[1] c[2] f[2] ... c[N] f[N]
where c[i] is a character chosen from {'0' - '9', 'a' - 'z', 'A' - 'Z', '_'}, and f[i] is the frequency 
of c[i] and is an integer no more than 1000. The next line gives a positive integer M (≤1000), then followed
by M student submissions. Each student submission consists of N lines, each in the format:
c[i] code[i]
where c[i] is the i-th character and code[i] is an non-empty string of no more than 63 '0's and '1's.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in each line either "Yes" if the student's submission is correct, or "No" if not.
Note: The optimal solution is not necessarily generated by Huffman algorithm. Any prefix code with code 
length being optimal is considered correct.
