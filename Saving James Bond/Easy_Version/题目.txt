解题思路：
先将所有的点（包括James和鳄鱼）的位置信息保存在图中，然后通过判断点与点之间能否跳过，来进行连接，
其中James的位置假设为（0，0），他能活动的范围是直径为15的小岛，所以所有与James连通的点的条件要减去活动的范围，
连通之后，通过DFS或BFS遍历找到是否有连通的集合中的点满足到达条件。
到达条件：最后的鳄鱼的x或y<=跳跃距离。

Saving James Bond - Easy Version 

This time let us consider the situation in the movie "Live and Let Die" in which James Bond, the world's 
most famous spy, was captured by a group of drug dealers. He was sent to a small piece of land at the center
of a lake filled with crocodiles. There he performed the most daring action to escape -- he jumped onto the head
of the nearest crocodile! Before the animal realized what was happening, James jumped again onto the next big 
head... Finally he reached the bank before the last crocodile could bite him (actually the stunt man was caught
by the big mouth and barely escaped with his extra thick boot).

Assume that the lake is a 100 by 100 square one. Assume that the center of the lake is at (0,0) and the northeast
corner at (50,50). The central island is a disk centered at (0,0) with the diameter of 15. A number of crocodiles
are in the lake at various positions. Given the coordinates of each crocodile and the distance that James could 
jump, you must tell him whether or not he can escape.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing two positive integers N (≤100), 
the number of crocodiles, and D, the maximum distance that James could jump. Then N lines follow, each containing 
the (x,y) location of a crocodile. Note that no two crocodiles are staying at the same position.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in a line "Yes" if James can escape, or "No" if not.
